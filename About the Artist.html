	<h1 style="font-size: medium">Charles Colman grew up in Sydney, and has 
	moved around the world since, ending up in Melbourne where he currently 
	lives.<o:p></o:p></h1>
	<h1 style="font-size: medium">His career was in music, as a conductor and 
	secondary teacher, but he also had a love of painting and studied at the 
	Julian Ashton Art School in 1983. <o:p></o:p></h1>
	<h1 style="font-size: medium">While living in Italy teaching English for 3 
	years during the mid 1990s, his desire to paint was rekindled as he absorbed 
	the beautiful scenes there. With his mother’s watercolour paint box in his 
	backpack, he started painting again with renewed passion.<o:p></o:p></h1>
	<h1 style="font-size: medium">On returning to Brisbane, Australia in 1999, 
	the next 15 years of his life was a busy mix of English and music teaching, 
	conducting, running a B&amp;B and painting. <o:p></o:p></h1>
	<h1 style="font-size: medium">During this period he studied with several 
	prominent artists, including Ev Hales and Michelle Retschlag, and exhibited 
	with the Queensland Watercolour Society, The Half Dozen Group, and in a 
	successful duo exhibition with his niece, Sally Colman, in Brisbane. <o:p></o:p>
	</h1>
	<h1 style="font-size: medium">A short summary of his lifelong music career 
	starts with his graduation in 1956 from Sydney University, with Honours in 
	Music, soon afterwards continuing his studies in London, Munich and Siena.<o:p></o:p></h1>
	<h1 style="font-size: medium">He began his Australian music career by taking 
	over an established chamber choir, The Leonine Consort, and developing it 
	into the leading vocal chamber ensemble in Australia. In 1978 he hand-picked 
	8 singers to help him refine the Consort into a full-time, fully 
	professional group, which was a leader in the field. Their concerts often 
	included an elite chamber orchestra. The vocal ensemble performed in all the 
	eastern capitals, as well as throughout S.E. Asia. In 1984 he founded and 
	directed The Song Company, another versatile and technically brilliant 
	ensemble that can still be heard in concert halls in Australia and abroad.<o:p></o:p></h1>
	<h1 style="font-size: medium">Now resident in Melbourne, Charles continues 
	to paint his favourite subjects: the mountains, rivers, trees, forests and 
	seascapes of Australia. His paintings hang in private collections in 
	Australia, Europe and America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
